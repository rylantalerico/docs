## Customizing your links

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Link color" icon="palette">
    With link color, you can set the accent color of your link. Crate.fm
    analyzes the colors in your artwork to suggest a color that matches your
    track.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Allow downloads?" icon="download">
    If allow downloads is "Yes," anyone recieving your link can download your
    track. If it's "No," they can only stream your track.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reset link" icon="ban">
    You can reset access to your link by clicking "Reset link."  
    
    After you reset your link, the original link to your track will no longer be accessible, and
    your track will have a new sharing link, which you can copy with the "Copy
    link" button.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Note from the creator" icon="pen">
    Add a note to your link to give your listeners more context about your
    track.
  </Accordion>
<Accordion title="Release date" icon="calendar">
    As Crate.fm is designed to store your unreleased music, you can set a release date to let people know when your song will be available on streaming platforms.

    Setting a release date is great for sharing music with fans before a release or sharing music with playlists, labels, and publishers. The person receiving your link can add your release date to their calendar.

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Audio analysis" icon="music">
    Share your track's key and BPM (detected via Crate.fm AI ðŸ¤¯) with your links.

    If you're a producer, share your key & BPM to make it easier for collaborators to work with your beats and loops.

  </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Lyrics" icon="file">
    Adding lyrics to your links is a great way to help people connect with your songs.

    If you're a songwriter, sharing your lyrics with a Crate.fm link after a session is a great way to keep everyone on the same page.
